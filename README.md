# Simple Blog 

A Simple blog developed using PHP, MySQL & Memcached.



### What is Memcached?

Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

 

### Installation

You need to install the memcache extension in the php directory and then restart the Server.

```sh
